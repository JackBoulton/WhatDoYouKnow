### Digital Interactive Media - Staffordshire University

This is a repository for my artifact for the Developing Interactive Media (DIM) module as part of my Applied Computering HND with Staffordshire University. This project was the first time I worked with an Android application and the first time working with Java. This project was marked at distinction level.

The brief for DIM was an a piece of interactive media aimed at school children between Key Stage 1 (Primary School) and Key Stage 3 (Secondary School) and part of the school curriculum.

This app is a Japanese language app aimed at Key Stage 1. Japanese language falls under Modern Foreign Languages and research showed that children retain foreign languages easier than older children and adults so the younger the app is aimed at the greater benefit they have from the app.

What Do You Know teaches children the vowels used in Hirigana, the Japanese alphabet, so children know how to pronounce words and phrases. Children also learn words for some animals and the concept of honrifics in Japanese culture. The final part of the app is a test to challenge children on what they learned previously on the app.
