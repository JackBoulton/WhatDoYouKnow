    <string name="japPage1">Before you start learning Japanese, first you need to know how they speak.\nJapanese uses a lot of A, E, I, O and U and these sound different than they do in English\n\nOur first lesson will be on learning to say A, I, U, E and O\n\nNext lesson&#8230;</string>
    <string name="japA1">\nSounds like the A in \'C-a-r\' or \'A-wful\'\n\nCan you say A?\n\nImagine you\'ve just thought of a great idea, telling everyone \"Ah! That\'s it!\"\n\nRemember, vowel sounds always sound the same in Japanese. Not like English where the A sound in \'today\' and the A sound in \'car\' are different</string>

    <string name="jap3Body">\nSounds like the English \'E\'. Imagine the \'E\' sound in Eel\n\nIt might be hard to remember because \'い\' sounds like the English \'E\', not \'I\' but try to use that to help you. Remember that it\'s not the same and remember the eels</string>
